# Amazon-Deforestation-Analysis-Remote-Sensing-Project
This is the Amazon Rainforest Deforestation Analysis Project that I did, it contains all the files where I worked with remote sensing tools like ArcGIS and Erdas Imagine. 



We are looking at deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon, a place covered by thick forest. In particular, we would like to see how much of the forest has been cut down to so make room for industrial development. In the Amazon, many areas that were once covered by forest have been converted to mainly agriculture land. Our study area covers an area of (INSERT SQUARE AREA) and contains mainly agricultural land surrounded by forest. We are looking at Landsat 7 ETM+ and Landsat 8 OLI images from May 2013, May 2017, May 2022. Our data utilized 6 bands (2-7): Blue, Green, Red, NIR, SWIR1, and SWIR2. With the region being very big, we cropped our images specifically to North of Manaus, along Hwy 174. The area is located in the centroid of the towns Sao Luis, Sao Luiz, and Sao Joao Da Baliza. 


THE FILES ARE TOO BIG TO UPLOAD SO THESE ARE JUST A FEW
